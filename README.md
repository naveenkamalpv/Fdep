## What is it?
___

Flying for business is full of uncertainty. The Delay Predictor is a  AI technology tool tha help you understand some of that uncertainty and predict flight delay based on input provided. We give you up to the minute forecasts so you're the first to know if your flight is at risk of being delayed.


## How does it work?
___

There are two portals for flight delay prediction; one for passengers, one for airline authorities. The passengers will be able to know whether their flight may get delayed or not, even when they are booking their flights. The airline authorities will be able to know by how much minutes the flight is likely to get delayed after the departure.
 
The Delay Predictor provides flight information  in advance of your departure date.
Simply input your flight details and if your flight is in our inventory, the tool will provide you with the likelihood of your flight being delayed and even how long your delay may be.
